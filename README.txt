Function for doing string variable substitutions in AS3.

Inspired by python's print and strtime.

MIT licensed.

Some basic usage:

import br.com.stimuli.string.printf;
// objects are substitued in the other they appear

printf("This is an %s library for creating %s", "Actioscript 3.0", "strings");
// outputs: "This is an Actioscript 3.0 lybrary for creating strings";
// you can also format numbers:

printf("You can also display numbers like PI: %f, and format them to a fixed precision, such as PI with 3 decimal places %.3f", Math.PI, Math.PI);
// outputs: " You can also display numbers like PI: 3.141592653589793, and format them to a fixed precision, such as PI with 3 decimal places 3.142"
// Instead of positional (the order of arguments to print f, you can also use propertie of an object):
var userInfo : Object = {
"name": "Arthur Debert",
"email": "arthur@stimuli.com.br",
"website":"http://www.stimuli.com.br/",
"ocupation": "developer"
}

printf("My name is %(name)s and I am a %(ocupation)s. You can read more on my personal %(website)s, or reach me through my %(email)s", userInfo);
// outputs: "My name is Arthur Debert and I am a developer. You can read more on my personal http://www.stimuli.com.br/, or reach me through my arthur@stimuli.com.br"
// you can also use date parts:
var date : Date = new Date();
printf("Today is %d/%m/%Y", date, date, date)
